I am a Ph.D. Candidate and Teaching Fellow in the Department of English at Queenâ€™s University and a Graduate Research Assistant on the <I>Digital Victorian Periodical Poetry</i> project at the University of Victoria. I hold an M.A. from the University of Victoria (with a concentration in Nineteenth-Century Studies) and a B.A. (Hons, with distinction) from Toronto Metropolitan University (formerly Ryerson University), both in English Language and Literature. My research interests include nineteenth-century literature and culture, the Victorian periodical press, popular fiction, print culture, and the digital humanities.
